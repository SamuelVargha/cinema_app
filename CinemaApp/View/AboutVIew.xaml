                        CinemaApp is a modern movie screening and seat reservation system
                        built for small cinemas and independent movie spaces.

                        It provides a clear and intuitive interface for browsing movies,
                        viewing screenings, and reserving seats with a visual seat layout.

                        The application focuses on simplicity, a clean visual style, and
                        smooth user experience. Users can view available screenings, select
                        their seats in an interactive grid, and create reservations that are
                        linked to their account.

                        CinemaApp is designed to be lightweight, fast, and easily extendable
                        with new features such as user profiles, payment integration,
                        and ticket generation.
